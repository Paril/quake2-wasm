This is a Quake II game DLL that loads "game.wasm" compiled WebAssembly data. It can also load AoT-compiled wasm, using the wamrc from https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime

You'll need to set up a build of WAMR to be able to compile this.

# Compiling Game WASMs
For information about compiling a .wasm or .aot, see https://github.com/Paril/quake2-source-archive - the sister project which archives existing sources in a format that allows easy compilation into WASMs.
